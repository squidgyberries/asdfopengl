# asdfopengl
A random terribly made OpenGL project based on [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com).

This project uses:
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
- [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm)
- [Glad 2](https://gen.glad.sh)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- [~~Nuklear~~](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) Used to use, it randomly broke one day, still bundles it.
